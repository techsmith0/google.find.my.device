There are several things that you certainly don’t want to happen in life. One of those things is misplacing or losing your smartphone. And it is not only because you’ll have to buy a new one or it will become an added expense. The main reason behind it is the data stored in the device. Modern smartphones contain lots of personal data, login credentials, banking details and other important data that you can’t risk losing.

If in an unfortunate situation, you have misplaced or lost your Android phone, then there’s a built-in feature called Find My Devie that comes with almost every Android smartphone that allows users to remotely locate the lost phone and then lock or erase it.

## How to Use Google Find My Device

* Start by opening a browser tab, then go to google.com/android/find and log into your Google account.
* Find My Device will attempt to detect your smartphone, smartwatch, or tablet. If location services are on, Find My Device will reveal its location. If it's working, you'll see a map with a pin dropped at the device's location.
* Once you get Find My Device up and running, you can do one of three things:
 * Play Sound: Make your Android play a sound, even if it's set to silent.
 * Secure Device: You can lock your device remotely if you think it's lost or stolen. Optionally, you can add a message and a phone number to the lock screen in case someone finds it and wants to return the device.
 * Erase Device: If you don't think you're getting your device back, you can wipe it so no one can access your data. Wiping performs a factory reset on your device, but if your phone is offline, you won't be able to wipe it until it regains a connection.

## What Is Google's Find My Device?

Google's Find My Device feature (previously Android Device Manager) helps you locate, and if necessary, remotely lock down your smartphone, tablet, and smartwatch, or even wipe the device clean in case of theft or you've given up on finding it.

You set up Google Find My Device on any of your Android devices and then use it to locate your device from your computer or another one of your Androids using the Find My Device app. Sign in to the app using your Google credentials, and you’ll get the same experience as on desktop.
